      <h2>What is PregNut?</h2>
      <p>PregNut is a handy food lookup tool for pregnant women who are nuts about nutrition science. If you are one of these women, who we affectionately call "pregnuts," you can use it to discover which foods contain more (or less) of the 15 most essential nutrients for a healthy pregnancy.</p>
      <p>While most doctors offices readily provide lists of pregnancy approved foods, as well as the key nutrients for pregnancy, it can be challenging to find detailed information about which specific foods help you reach your pregnancy nutrition goals. This task was so frustrating that my wife kindly forced me to create this app. So yeah, you should probably thank her.</p>

    <div>
      <p>The top food page shows the most nutritionally dense options for each of 15 essential nutrients, broken down by food group categories.</p>
      <p>One of the toggles lets you switch between each of these nutrients. The other lets you select nutrient sources that are "natural" vs "processed" (including items that are fortified with vitamins).</p>
      <p>If you hover over any food item you will see a pop up with the complete nutrition summary for that food item.</p>

    <h2>Search</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="split">
    <div>
      <p>Begin typing in the food search bar and you will see a list of foods that match your query. Select one and click Search.</p>
      <p>This will take you to a summary page where you can see what percent of your daily need is met by 100 grams of this food.</p>
      <p>All foods use 100 gram (3.5 oz) portions to compare apples to oranges (see what I did there). How much is this? It depends on the food, but for many items its close to 1 cup.</p>
      <p>If the item does not show up in the search bar as you type, that item does not exist in the database.</p>

    <h2>The nutrients</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="split">
    <div>
      <p>Yes! All of the nutritional recommendations are based on peer reviewed evidence and guidelines set by some of the leading healthcare organizations around the world.</p>
      <p>The most important consideration for including a nutrient as "essential" was a unison of scientific voices around that nutrient.

  <p>PregNut is created with the intention to be a starting point for some of your pregnancy nutrition research. It is not meant to replace your doctor or nutritionist, nor to diagnose, cure, or treat any disease, and certainly not to be the final word on any nutrition science.</p>
  <p>The nutritional contents of every food item is extracted from the <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/nutrient-data-laboratory/docs/usda-national-nutrient-database-for-standard-reference/">USDA Food Composition Database</a>, which is offered to the public by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The food naming was cleaned up for ease of use, but the numerical data is unaltered.</p>
